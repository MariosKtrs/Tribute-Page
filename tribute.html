          <strong>A Summary of Alan Turing's Life</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1912</strong> - Born in Maida Vale, London to Ethel Sara Turing and Julius Mathison Turing.
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>1918</strong> - Turing joins St Michael’s day school in Hastings, where his headmistress recognised he was special.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1922</strong> - Turing joins an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1926</strong> - Went on to Sherborne School, a boarding independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset, where he boarded at Westcott House. The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike, in Britain, but Turing was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied 97 km from Southampton to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1928</strong> - Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of Newton's laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1930</strong> - Turing’s close school friend Christopher Morcom dies suddenly from bovine tuberculosis. Turing is devastated, renounces his religious faith and becomes an atheist.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1931</strong> - 
Enters King’s College, Cambridge, as mathematics scholar and gains first-class honours in Mathematics.
          </li>
<li>
  <strong>1935</strong> - Turing was elected a Fellow of King's College on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved a version of the central limit theorem Unknown to Turing, this version of the theorem had already been proven, in 1922, by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg. Despite this, the committee found Turing's methods original and so regarded the work worthy of consideration for the fellowship.
</li>
<li>
  <strong>1936</strong> - Turing published his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem". It was published in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society journal in two parts, the first on 30 November and the second on 23 December. In this paper, Turing reformulated Kurt Gödel's 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines.
</li>
<li>
  <strong>1938</strong> - Turing worked part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), the British codebreaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma cipher machine used by Nazi Germany, together with Dilly Knox, a senior GC&CS codebreaker.
</li>
<li>
 <strong>1942</strong> - Turing travelled to the United States in November and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington.
</li>
<li>
  <strong>1942</strong> Turing devised a technique termed Turingery (or jokingly Turingismus) for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans' new Geheimschreiber (secret writer) machine. This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of wheel-breaking, i.e., a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny's wheels.
</li>
<li>
<strong>1946</strong> - 
Turing and his group pioneer modern computer programming, writing a library of sophisticated programs for the unbuilt ACE.
Turing presents a course of lectures on Versions V, VI, and VII of the ACE design, at the Ministry of Supply in London (Dec. 1946 to Feb. 1947). Kilburn attends from Manchester University.
</li>
<li>
  <strong>1948</strong> - He became Deputy Director of the Computing Laboratory, working on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers—the Manchester Mark 1.
</li>
<li><strong>1951</strong> - Turing is elected Fellow of the Royal Society FRS and also gives a talk about Artificial Intelligence on the BBC radio’s Third Programme.
<li>
  <strong>1954</strong> - Turing was found dead at his house at 43 Adlington Road, Wilmslow by his housekeeper. He had died the previous day at the age of 41. Cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death.
